<h3>AsyncTask and ConcurrentHashMap (Assignment 2)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

This assignment will extend the Palantiri app from <A
HREF="://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment1/">assignment
1</a> to use AsyncTasks and ConcurrentHashMap to develop an Android
app containing a resource manager that restricts the number of Beings
from Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into a fixed number of
Palantiri. As before, this Android program is structured in accordance
with the <A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern to help alleviate various accidental complexities
associated with developing concurrent Android apps. <P>

The classes in the View layer are provided to you.  The main
PalantiriActivity first prompts the user to enter various
configuration parameters, such as the number of Palantiri and Beings.
It then starts the GazingSimulationActivity, which initializes the
Presenter layer and then starts the Presenter layer's processing
logic.  The bulk of the concurrent processing is performed by the
Presenter and Model layers.  If you correctly complete the
implementation of the skeletons in these layers the Palantiri app will
run successfully without throwing any exceptions. <P>

This Android app uses various features of AsyncTask (which is
described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQJnejqcAZw&index=32&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-o92SLinqk&index=33&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">here</a>)
and ThreadPoolExecutor (which is described <A
HREF="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html">here</a>).
You'll also need to understand how to use Java ConcurrentHashMap work,
which is described <A
HREF="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html">here</A>.

Please watch these videos, read the documentation, and look at the
skeleton code to ensure you understand how to program Java AsyncTasks
and ConcurrentHashMaps.  Naturally, we'll also cover these topics in
the live lectures during weeks 2 and 3 of the MOOC and answer your
questions during Virtual Office Hours in weeks 2 and 3. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure</H4>

The assignment is split into the following three directories:

<UL> <LI> <A HREF="A2-Android-App">A2-Android-App</A>, which conains
the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  You'll need to import this project
into your IDE as an Android app.

<LI> <A HREF="A2-Java-Test">A2-Java-Test</A>, which is a JUnit test
that exercises all the PalantiriManager features and can be used to
help test the functionality created in the assignment.  You'll need to
import this project into Eclipse as a Java app.

<LI> <A HREF="A2-Android-Test">A2-Android-Test</A>, which is a
Robotium test that runs your app automatically.  You'll need to import
this project into your IDE as an Android app.

</UL>

To compile the the A2-Android-App and A2-Android-Test apps you need to
use the provided Eclipse ADT project, which should also work
"out-of-the-box" with Android Studio.  In Eclipse you can run these
projects by right-clicking the project's name in the Package Explorer
and selecting Run As -> Android Application for A2-Android-App and Run
As -> Android JUnit Test for A2-Android-Test.  Your IDE should
automatically select an Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one
created.  <P>

To compile the the A2-Java-Test you need to use the provided Eclipse
project.  You can run this project by right-clicking the project's
name in the Package Explorer and selecting Run As -> JUnit Test. <P>

<A NAME="description">
<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the src directory you'll find a number of files, all of which you
should read.  You'll need to modify several files containing the
skeleton Java code that you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You
fill in here" comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE
THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO -- You
fill in here" portions!!! <P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Finish the implementation of certain methods in the
<CODE>PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE> and
<CODE>BeingAsyncTask.java</CODE> defined by the Presenter layer
residing in <CODE>src/edu/vandy/presenter/</CODE>.  You'll need to (1)
complete the <CODE>createAndExecuteBeingTasks()</CODE> and
<CODE>newThread()</CODE> methods in
<CODE>PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE> to create/start a BeingAsyncTask
and BeingThread for each Being, which uses a thread from a fixed-sized
ThreadPoolExecutor to concurrently acquires a Palantir from the Model
layer and gaze into it for a certain amount of time and (2) complete
the <CODE>doInBackground()</CODE> and <CODE>onProgressUpdate()</CODE>
methods in <CODE>BeingAsyncTask.java</CODE> to handle cancellations
and updates to the GUI. <P>

<LI> Finish the implementation of the Model layer in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/model/PalantiriManager.java</CODE>.  In
particular, you'll use a Java Semaphore and ConcurrentHashMap to
mediate concurrent access to the Palantiri resources and keep track of
which Palantiri are currently free and which are in use. <P>

</UL>

The program will be considered "correct" if it successfully completes
a simulation of N Palantiri and M Beings without crashing or throwing
any exceptions. The Palantir and Beings are color coded to represent
their state: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Beings</B> - Yellow means the Being is idle, Red means it's
waiting to acquire a Palantir, and Green means it's gazing into a
Palantir.<P> 

<LI> <B>Palantiri</B> - Gray means the Palantir is inactive, Green
means it is available for use, and Red means it is in use (i.e., a
Being is currently gazing into it).<P>

</UL>

A "correct" simulation should restrict the number of gazing Beings to
the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there are four Palantiri
in the simulation, then only four Being dots should ever be Green on
the screen at a time. <P>

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment2/">GitHub</a>
account.  Pull the appropriate skeleton code in your repository, read
it carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.  <P>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with writing
multi-threaded programs using an Android IDE and Android AsyncTask, as
well as applying core Java synchronizers (such as Semaphore) and
concurrent collections (such as ConcurrentHashMap). <P>
