  <h4>Overview of the Downloaded Image Viewer Assignment</h4>

  <p> 

    The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using
    Android Services by developing an app containing a main Activity
    that prompts the user for URLs of images to download concurrently
    via a DownloadImagesService and then view via a
    DisplayImagesActivity.  DownloadImagesService is implemented via
    an Android <A
    HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services.html">Bound
    Service</A>, as covered in <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMaTUNVdeBI&index=36&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">this
    video</a>, and several instances of the Android <A
    HREF="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Messenger.html">Messenger</a>
    class, which is covered in the following videos:

    <UL>

    <LI> <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfu14K74DxQ&index=41&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">Service to Activity Communication via Android Messenger</a>.
    <LI> <a HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGH0U_p1pow&index=42&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">Programming Bound Services with Messengers (Part 1)</a>
    <LI> <a HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRFw7xaZ_Mg&index=43&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">Programming Bound Services with Messengers (Part 2)</a>
    </UL>

  In addition, the RequestHandler (which is associated with the
  DownloadImagesBoundService) will use an Java ExecutorService to
  concurrently download images and send their URIs back to the
  Activity.  The Java ExecutorService is covered
  in <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NAlvSkK9-k&index=27&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX">this</a>
  video.  Material presented during lectures in Weeks 2 of the class
  are also relevant to this assignment.

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment2">here</a>.
    Pull the appropriate skeleton code into your repository, read it
    carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers, which reside in the
    following Java source files: DownloadImagesBoundService.java,
    ImageOpsBoundService.java, RequestHandler.java, ReplyMessage.java,
    and RequestMessage.java. </p>

  <P> The motivations for the pattern-oriented design of this
  assignment include making it easy to do the following:

  <UL>

  <LI> <P> Handle runtime configuration changes by placing the bulk of
  the state in the ImageOpsImpl class and using the
  RetainedFragmentManager to store/retrieve this state during runtime
  configuration changes. </P>

  <LI> <P> Support both Started and Bound Service implementations
  seamlessly within a common framework. </P>

  <LI> <P> Plug in different concurrency models for the Bound and/or
  Started Services without affecting other parts of the app
  design/implementation. </P>

  <LI> <P> Change the request and reply message formats without
  affecting other parts of the app design/implementation. </P>

  <LI> <P> Change the way in which the downloaded images are displayed
  without affecting other parts of the app design/implementation. </P>

  <LI> <P> Support totally different application requirements (e.g.,
  retrieving/displaying weather data from a web service
  vs. downloading/displaying images) with minimal impact on other
  parts of the app design/implementation. </P>

  </UL> 

  <P> These are all useful capabilities, irrespective of the details
  of an Android application.  The key point of the POSA MOOCs is to
  teach <EM>by example</EM> how to solve complex, real-world problems
  with concurrency and communication by applying patterns and
  frameworks.  The best way to do this is by getting experience
  reading and writing these sorts of pattern-oriented applications and
  frameworks. </P>

  <p> Note that there are no automated unit tests for this
  assignment. Instead, you'll know the program is working when you can
  successfully download and view an image.  However, make sure your
  program works for both valid and invalid URL input.

  <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
  <p>

  This assignment is designed to further your understanding with
  programming Android Services in Java.  It's harder than the first
  assignment since you'll need to write some code on the client-side,
  as well as code to perform concurrent background processing with an
  Android Bound Service on the server-side. Therefore, start early and
  come to Virtual Office Hours if you have questions or run into
  problems.  </p>
