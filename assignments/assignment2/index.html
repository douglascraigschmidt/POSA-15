  <h4>Overview of the Downloaded Image Viewer Assignment</h4>

  <p> 

    The purpose of this assignment is to extend your solution to <A
    HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment1">assignment
    1</a> by giving you experience using both an Android Started
    Service and a Bound Service by developing an app containing a main
    Activity that prompts the user for URLs of images to download
    concurrently via a DownloadImagesBoundService and then view via a
    DisplayImagesActivity.  DownloadImagesBoundService is implemented
    via an Android <A
    HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services.html">Bound
    Service</A>, as covered in <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMaTUNVdeBI&index=36&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">this
    video</a>, and several instances of the Android <A
    HREF="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Messenger.html">Messenger</a>
    class, which is covered in the following videos:

    <UL>

    <LI> <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfu14K74DxQ&index=41&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">Service to Activity Communication via Android Messenger</a>.

    </UL>

  In addition, the RequestHandler (which is associated with the
  DownloadImagesBoundService) will use an Java ExecutorService to
  concurrently download images and send their URIs back to the
  Activity.  The Java ExecutorService is covered in <A
  HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NAlvSkK9-k&index=27&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4KSJPUyaQCj7x--NQ6kvcX">this</a>
  video.

This Android program is structured in accordance with the <A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern to help alleviate various accidental complexities
associated with developing concurrent Android apps.  The classes in
the View layer are provided to you.  The main DownloadImagesActivity
first prompts the user to enter the URLs for various images to
download.  After these URLs are entered the user can click the
download button, which will download the images and launch the
DisplayImagesActivity to display them to the user. <P>

The bulk of the concurrent processing is performed by the Model layer.
This layer is implemented using the <A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern">Bridge pattern</A>
to decouple the interface of the the Model layer from the particular
type of Service used to implement this layer.  The app will run
successfully without throwing any exceptions if you correctly complete
the implementation of the skeletons in this layer, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  <P>

  <P> The motivations for the pattern-oriented design of this
  assignment include making it easy to do the following:

  <UL>

  <LI> <P> Handle runtime configuration changes by placing the bulk of
  the state in the Presenter and Model layers so this state can be
  stored/retrieved during runtime configuration changes that cause the
  DownloadImagesActivity to be destroyed and recreated. </P>

  <LI> <P> Support both Started and Bound Service implementations
  seamlessly within a common framework. The Started Service
  implementation was the focus of assignment 1 and the Bound Service
  implementation is the focus of this assignment. </P>

  <LI> <P> Plug in different concurrency models for the Bound and/or
  Started Services without affecting other parts of the app
  design/implementation. </P>

  <LI> <P> Change the request and reply message formats without
  affecting other parts of the app design/implementation. </P>

  <LI> <P> Change the way in which the downloaded images are displayed
  without affecting other parts of the app design/implementation. </P>

  <LI> <P> Support totally different application requirements (e.g.,
  retrieving/displaying weather data from a web service
  vs. downloading/displaying images) with minimal impact on other
  parts of the app design/implementation. </P>

  </UL> 

<P> These are all useful capabilities, irrespective of the details of
an Android application.  The key point of the POSA MOOCs is to teach
<EM>by example</EM> how to solve complex, real-world problems with
concurrency and communication by applying patterns and frameworks.
The best way to do this is by getting experience reading and writing
these sorts of pattern-oriented applications and frameworks.
Therefore, please watch these videos, read the documentation, and look
at the skeleton code to ensure you understand how to program Android
Started Services.  Naturally, we'll also cover these topics in the
lectures during week 2 of the MOOC and answer your questions during
Virtual Office Hours in week 2. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure</H4>

The assignment is split into the following directories:

<UL> <LI> <A HREF="A2-Android-App">A2-Android-App</A>, which conains
the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  You'll need to import this project
into your IDE as an Android app.<P>

<LI> <A HREF="A2-Android-Test">A2-Android-Test</A>, which is a
Robotium test that runs your app automatically.  You'll need to import
this project into your IDE as an Android app and configure it to use
the Robotium test automation framework, which is available <A
HREF="https://github.com/robotiumtech/robotium">here</A>. <P>

</UL>

To compile the the A2-Android-App and A2-Android-Test apps you need to
use the provided Eclipse ADT project, which should also work
"out-of-the-box" with Android Studio.  In Eclipse you can run these
projects by right-clicking the project's name in the Package Explorer
and selecting Run As -> Android Application for A2-Android-App and Run
As -> Android JUnit Test for A2-Android-Test.  Your IDE should
automatically select an Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one
created.  <P>

<P><HR width=50% align=left><P>
<A NAME="description">
<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the src directory you'll find a number of files, all of which you
should read.  You'll need to modify several files containing the
skeleton Java code that you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You
fill in here" comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE
THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO -- You
fill in here" portions!!! <P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Finish the implementation of certain methods in the
<CODE>ImageModelImplBoundService.java</CODE> file defined by the Model
layer residing in <CODE>src/edu/vandy/model</CODE>.  These methods
implement the client-side of the Android Bound Service feature. <P>

<LI> Finish the implementation of certain methods in the
<CODE>DownloadImagesBoundService.java</CODE> file defined by the Model
layer residing in <CODE>src/edu/vandy/model/services</CODE>.  These
methods implement the server-side of the Android Bound Service to
download an an image requested via data in an intent, store the image
in a local file on the local device, and return the image file's URI
back to the client in the Model layer via the Messenger passed with
the intent. <P>

<LI> Copy your (working) implementations of
<CODE>ReplyMessage.java</CODE> and <CODE>RequestMessage.java</CODE>
files defined by the Model layer in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/model/datamodel</CODE> and
<CODE>DownloadImagesStartedService.java</CODE> in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/model/services</CODE>.  These files are officially
part of assignment 2, but you'll need them to get the program to
compile and work cleanly.

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment2">here</a>.
    Pull the appropriate skeleton code into your repository, read it
    carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers, which reside in the
    following Java source files: DownloadImagesBoundService.java,
    ImageOpsBoundService.java, RequestHandler.java, ReplyMessage.java,
    and RequestMessage.java. </p>

  <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
  <p>

  This assignment is designed to further your understanding with
  programming Android Bound Services in Java.  It's harder than the
  first assignment since you'll need to write some code on the
  client-side, as well as code to perform concurrent background
  processing with an Android Bound Service on the
  server-side. Therefore, start early and come to Virtual Office Hours
  if you have questions or run into problems.  </p>
