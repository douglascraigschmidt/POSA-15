  <h4>Overview of the Concurrent Ping-Pong Application Assignment</h4>

  <p>

    The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using
    Android HaMeR framework classes to develop a multi-threaded app
    that uses message passing to alternate printing "ping" and "pong"
    to the user display.  In particular, this assignment involves the
    use of HaMeR classes like HandlerThread, Handler, Looper, and
    (implicitly) MessageQueue. You'll also need to use a Java
    CyclicBarrier to ensure that HandlerThreads are fully initialized
    before the concurrent ping-pong algorithm begins. <EM><b>No</b>
    other Java synchronization mechanisms are needed for this
    assignment</em>. <P>

  <p> In addition to the lectures on Android we'll present in class
    during week 2, the following resources may be helpful in
    completing portions of this assignment: </p>

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment2">here</a>.
    Pull the appropriate skeleton code in your repository, read it
    carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.  In addition to
    filling in the "TODO" code snippets, I also recommend looking
    carefully at the code provided in the MainActivity.java class,
    which illustrates other interesting uses of the HaMeR
    framework.</p>

  <p> Note that there are no automated unit tests for this
  assignment. Instead, you'll know the program is working when you can
  successfully generate "ping" and "pong" requests in the proper
  order.  Make sure that your program works properly for both correct
  and incorrect input entered by the user.

  <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
  <p>

  This assignment is designed to help you deepen your familiarity with
  concurrent programming of the Android HaMeR framework.  It's more
  complicated than assignment1, so make sure you start early and
  participate in Virtual Office Hours if you have questions or run
  into problems.  </p>
