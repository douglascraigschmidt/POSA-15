  <h4>Overview of the Downloaded Image Viewer Assignment</h4>

  <p>

    The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using
    Android to develop an app that contains a MainActivity that
    prompts the user for a URL to an image and then uses Intents and
    the DownloadImageActivity to download the image and view it via
    the Gallery app. The DownloadImageActivity should use the Android
    "HaMeR" concurrency framework, which is covered in <A

    video</a>. <P>

  <p> In addition to the lectures on Android we'll present in class,
    the following resources may be helpful in completing portions of
    this assignment: </p>

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment1">here</a>.
    Pull the appropriate skeleton code in your repository, read it
    carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <p> Note that there are no automated unit tests for this
  assignment. Instead, you'll know the program is working when you can
  successfully download and view an image.  Make sure that your
  program works properly for both valid and invalid URLs entered by
  the user.
