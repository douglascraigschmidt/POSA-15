<h4>Overview of the Download Image Viewer Assignment</h4>

<p>

The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using Android
Services by developing an app containing a main Activity that prompts
the user for URLs of images to download concurrently via a
DownloadImagesStartedService and then view via a
DisplayImagesActivity.  The DownloadImagesStartedService should use
the Android <A
HREF="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/IntentService.html">IntentService</a>
framework, which is a type of Started Service covered in <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9tx9sRmn48&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=39">this
video</a> and the Android <A
HREF="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Messenger.html">Messenger</a>
class, which is covered in this <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bfu14K74DxQ&index=41&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">video</a>.

This Android program is structured in accordance with the <A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern to help alleviate various accidental complexities
associated with developing concurrent Android apps.  The classes in
the View layer are provided to you.  The main DownloadImagesActivity
first prompts the user to enter the URLs for various images to
download.  After these URLs are entered the user can click the
download button, which will download the images and launch the
DisplayImagesActivity to display them to the user. <P>

The bulk of the concurrent processing is performed by the Model layer.
This layer is implemented using the <A
HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern">Bridge pattern</A>
to decouple the interface of the the Model layer from the particular
type of Service used to implement this layer.  The app will run
successfully without throwing any exceptions if you correctly complete
the implementation of the skeletons in this layer, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  <P>

  <P> The motivations for the pattern-oriented design of this
  assignment include making it easy to do the following:

  <UL>

  <LI> <P> Handle runtime configuration changes by placing the bulk of
  the state in the Presenter and Model layers so this state can be
  stored/retrieved during runtime configuration changes that cause the
  DownloadImagesActivity to be destroyed and recreated. </P>

  <LI> <P> Support both Started and Bound Service implementations
  seamlessly within a common framework. The Bound Services
  implementation will be the focus of assignment 2. </P>

  <LI> <P> Plug in different concurrency models for the Bound and/or
  Started Services without affecting other parts of the app
  design/implementation. </P>

  <LI> <P> Change the request and reply message formats without
  affecting other parts of the app design/implementation. </P>

  <LI> <P> Change the way in which the downloaded images are displayed
  without affecting other parts of the app design/implementation. </P>

  <LI> <P> Support totally different application requirements (e.g.,
  retrieving/displaying weather data from a web service
  vs. downloading/displaying images) with minimal impact on other
  parts of the app design/implementation. </P>

  </UL> 

<P> These are all useful capabilities, irrespective of the details of
an Android application.  The key point of the POSA MOOCs is to teach
<EM>by example</EM> how to solve complex, real-world problems with
concurrency and communication by applying patterns and frameworks.
The best way to do this is by getting experience reading and writing
these sorts of pattern-oriented applications and frameworks.
Therefore, please watch these videos, read the documentation, and look
at the skeleton code to ensure you understand how to program Android
Started Services.  Naturally, we'll also cover these topics in the
live lectures during weeks 1 and 2 of the MOOC and answer your
questions during Virtual Office Hours in weeks 1 and 2. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure</H4>

The assignment is split into the following directories:

<UL> <LI> <A HREF="A1-Android-App">A1-Android-App</A>, which conains
the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  You'll need to import this project
into your IDE as an Android app.<P>

<LI> <A HREF="A1-Android-Test">A1-Android-Test</A>, which is a
Robotium test that runs your app automatically.  You'll need to import
this project into your IDE as an Android app and configure it to use
the Robotium test automation framework, which is available <A
HREF="https://github.com/robotiumtech/robotium">here</A>. <P>

</UL>

To compile the the A1-Android-App and A1-Android-Test apps you need to
use the provided Eclipse ADT project, which should also work
"out-of-the-box" with Android Studio.  In Eclipse you can run these
projects by right-clicking the project's name in the Package Explorer
and selecting Run As -> Android Application for A1-Android-App and Run
As -> Android JUnit Test for A1-Android-Test.  Your IDE should
automatically select an Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one
created.  <P>

<A NAME="description">
<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the src directory you'll find a number of files, all of which you
should read.  You'll need to modify several files containing the
skeleton Java code that you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You
fill in here" comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE
THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO -- You
fill in here" portions!!! <P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Finish the implementation of certain methods in the
<CODE>DownloadImagesStartedService.java</CODE> file defined by the
Model layer residing in <CODE>src/edu/vandy/model/services/</CODE>.
These methods use the IntentService to download an an image requested
via data in an intent, store the image in a local file on the local
device, and return the image file's URI back to the MainActivity via
the Messenger passed with the intent. <P>

<LI> Finish the implementation of certain methods in the
<CODE>ReplyMessage.java</CODE> and <CODE>RequestMessage.java</CODE>
files defined by the Model layer residing in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/model/datamodel/</CODE>.  These classes provide a
thin facade around the Android Message class that define the schema of
requests and replies from the DownloadImagesStartedService back to the
DownloadImagesActivity. <P>

</UL>

<h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment1">here</a>.
Pull the appropriate skeleton code in your repository, read it
carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

<h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
<p>

This assignment is designed to further your understanding with
programming Android Started Services and the IntentService framework
in Java. Start early and come to Virtual Office Hours if you have
questions or run into problems.  </p>
