<h3>Java Threads and Synchronizers (Assignment 1)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

In this assignment, you will use Java Thread, Runnable, and Semaphore
classes, as well as Java synchronized statements, to develop an
Android app containing a resource manager that restricts the number of
Beings from Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into a fixed number
of Palantiri.  If you're not yet a fan of Tolkein's Lord of the Ring's
trilogy, you can learn more about Palantiri <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir">here</a>. <P>

This Android program is structured in accordance with the <A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern to help alleviate various accidental complexities
associated with developing concurrent Android apps.  The classes in
the View layer are provided to you.  The main PalantiriActivity first
prompts the user to enter various configuration parameters, such as
the number of Palantiri and Beings.  It then starts the
GazingSimulationActivity, which initializes the Presenter layer and
then starts the Presenter layer's processing logic.  The bulk of the
concurrent processing is performed by the Presenter and Model layers.
If you correctly complete the implementation of the skeletons in these
layers the Palantiri app will run successfully without throwing any
exceptions. <P>

This Android app uses various features of Java Threads and Runnables,
which are described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eY5E0o56gaw&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=12">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpEeZUjTiS4&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=13">here</a>.
You'll also need to understand how to use Java Semaphores (described
<A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoaZTkot6-g&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=20">here</a>)
and synchronized statements, (described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3rcTTF45cA&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=25">here</a>).
Please watch these videos and look at the code to ensure you
understand how to program Java Threads and synchronizers.  Naturally,
we'll also cover these topics in the live lectures during week 1 of
the MOOC and answer your questions during Virtual Office Hours in
weeks 1 and 2. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure</H4>

The assignment is split into the following three directories:

<UL> <LI> <A HREF="A1-Android-App">A1-Android-App</A>, which conains
the skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>.  You'll need to import this project
into your IDE as an Android app.

<LI> <A HREF="A1-Java-Test">A1-Java-Test</A>, which is a JUnit test
that exercises all the PalantiriManager features and can be used to
help test the functionality created in Part 1 of the assignment.
You'll need to import this project into Eclipse as a Java app.

<LI> <A HREF="A1-Android-Test">A1-Android-Test</A>, which is a
Robotium test that runs your app automatically.  You'll need to import
this project into your IDE as an Android app.

</UL>

To compile the the A1-Android-App and A1-Android-Test apps you need to
use the provided Eclipse ADT project, which should also work
"out-of-the-box" with Android Studio.  In Eclipse you can run these
projects by right-clicking the project's name in the Package Explorer
and selecting Run As -> Android Application for A1-Android-App and Run
As -> Android JUnit Test for A1-Android-Test.  Your IDE should
automatically select an Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one
created.  <P>

To compile the the A1-Java-Test you need to use the provided Eclipse
project.  You can run this project by right-clicking the project's
name in the Package Explorer and selecting Run As -> JUnit Test. <P>

<A NAME="description">
<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the src directory you'll find a number of files, all of which you
should read.  You'll need to modify several files containing the
skeleton Java code that you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You
fill in here" comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE
THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO -- You
fill in here" portions!!! <P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Finish the implementation of class methods defined by the
Presenter layer residing in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/presenter/PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE>.  You'll
need to (1) create/start a BeingThread for each Being, which
concurrently acquires a Palantir from the Model layer and gazes into
it for a certain amount of time and (2) start a thread to wait for all
the Being threads to finish and then inform the View layer that the
simulation is done. <P>

<LI> Finish the implementation of the Model layer in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/model/PalantiriManager.java</CODE>.  In
particular, you'll use a Java Semaphore, HashMap, and synchronized
statements to mediate concurrent access to the Palantiri resources and
keep track of which Palantiri are currently free and which are in
use. <P>

</UL>

The program will be considered "correct" if it successfully completes
a simulation of N Palantiri and M Beings without crashing or throwing
any exceptions. The Palantir and Beings are color coded to represent
their state: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Beings</B> - Yellow means the Being is idle, Red means it's
waiting to acquire a Palantir, and Green means it's gazing into a
Palantir.<P> 

<LI> <B>Palantiri</B> - Gray means the Palantir is inactive, Green
means it is available for use, and Red means it is in use (i.e., a
Being is currently gazing into it).<P>

</UL>

A "correct" simulation should restrict the number of gazing Beings to
the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there are four Palantiri
in the simulation, then only four Being dots should ever be Green on
the screen at a time. <P>

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment1/">GitHub</a>
account.  Pull the appropriate skeleton code in your repository, read
it carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.  <P>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with writing
multi-threaded programs using an Android IDE and Java Threads, as well
as applying core Java synchronizers (such as Semaphore) and
synchronized statements to concurrently access collections (such as
HashMap).  It doesn't require you to program any Android concurrency
or communication frameworks, which we'll cover in the next
assignment. <P>
