  <h4>Overview of the Downloaded Images Viewer Assignment</h4>

  <p>

    The purpose of this "mini-project" assignment is to give you
    experience using Android concurrency frameworks to develop an app
    that prompts the user for a list of URL to images and then
    downloads these images, filters the images, and displays them.
    You have a great degree of flexibility in how you design and
    implement this app, as long as it meets the following requirements

    <UL> 

    <LI> Downloading and filtering the images should each be performed
    concurrently via different instances of the Android AsyncTask
    concurrency framework, which is covered <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQJnejqcAZw&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=32">here</a>
    and <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-o92SLinqk&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=33">here</a>. <P>

    <LI> All AsyncTasks should run concurrently using the
    AsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR and the executeOnExecutor() method. <P>

    <LI> The filter(s) used to process the image should at least be
    the gray-scale filter that's provided as part of the code
    skeletons distributed with the assignment. You're welcome to
    define other filters, but they are optional. <P>

    <LI> The app must handle runtime configuration changes properly in
    the context of concurrently executing instances of AsyncTask.
    Information on how to handle these types of changes is available
    <A
    HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html">here</a>
    and <A
    HREF="http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2013/04/retaining-objects-across-config-changes.html">here</a>.
    </UL>

    The material necessary to complete assignment 3 was presented in
    class during Weeks 2, 3, and 4.

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment3">here</a>.
    However, you don't need to use <EM>any</EM> of the supplied code
    if you'd like to write the app from scratch.  A quick walk-through
    of my design/implementation of assignment 3 will be available in
    the <A
    href="https://class.coursera.org/posaconcurrency-003/lecture/">video
    lectures</a>, though you are under <EM>no</EM> obligation to model
    your solution on my approach. </p>

  <p> Note that there are no automated unit tests for this
  assignment. Instead, you'll know the program is working when you can
  successfully download, filter, and view the filtered image.  Make
  sure that your program works properly for both valid and invalid
  URLs entered by the user.  You can get
  images at various resolutions from <A
  HREF="http://lorempixel.com/">this</A> website. </p>

  <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
  <p>

  This assignment is designed to help deepen your knowledge of
  concurrent programming with the Android AsyncTask framework, as well
  as how to successfully handle configuration changes in an Android
  device.  Make sure you start early and come to Virtual Office Hours
  if you have questions or run into problems.  </p>
