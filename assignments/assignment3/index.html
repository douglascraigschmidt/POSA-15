  <h3>Weather Service App (P2 - Assignment 3)</h3>

  <hr width=50% align=left>
  <h4>Overview of the Weather Service App</h4>

  <p> 

The purpose of this "mini-project" assignment is to give you
experience using Android to develop a complete Weather Service app
largely "from scratch".  This app should contain a WeatherActivity
that uses two Android Bound Services--one implementing a synchronous
AIDL-based two-way mechanism (e.g., WeatherServiceSync) and one
implementing an asynchronous AIDL-based two-way mechanism (e.g.,
WeatherServiceAsync)--to obtain weather information from a Weather
Service web service.  The Bound Services will require AIDL interfaces
to specify the methods they support, which provide a location obtained
via the WeatherActivity as a String (such as "Nashville, TN") and
return a WeatherData object to the WeatherActivity that can be used to
display various current weather-related information for that
location. </P>

<P> You have a great degree of flexibility in
how you design and implement this app, as long as it meets the
following requirements </P>

    <UL> 

    <LI> <p> WeatherActivity should support both synchronous and
    asynchronous AIDL-based two-way mechanisms for interacting with
    the WeatherServiceSync and WeatherServiceAsync, which are covered
    in the Week 3 videos on "The Android Interface Definition Language
    and Binder Framework".  To avoid blocking the UI Thread in the
    WeatherActivity, the synchronous two-way mechanism should use an
    AsyncTask, which is covered <A

    and <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-o92SLinqk&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=33">here</a>. </P>

    <LI> <P> The app must handle runtime configuration changes
    properly.  Information on how to handle these types of changes is
    available <A
    HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html">here</a>
    A video outlining several approaches to runtime configuration
    changes appears <A
    HREF="https://class.coursera.org/posacommunication-001/lecture/235">here</a>. </P>

    <LI> <P> The interfaces and parcelable WeatherData object used to
    communicate between the WeatherActivity and the WeatherServiceSync
    and WeatherServiceAsync should at least support the functionality
    defined by the AIDL files provided in the skeletons, though you're
    welcome to add further capabilities or edit these files as you see
    fit.  The WeatherActivity should <EM>not</EM> contact the Weather
    Service web service directly, but only via the getCurrentWeather()
    methods defined by the WeatherRequest and WeatherCall AIDL
    interfaces. WeatherActivity should display the weather-related
    fields in WeatherData in whatever format you desire. </P>

    <LI> <P> Since weather data doesn't change instantaeously, the
    WeatherServiceSync and WeatherServiceAsync should implement some
    for of <A
    HREF="http://kircher-schwanninger.de/michael/publications/Caching.pdf">caching
    pattern</A>, whereby a call by WeatherActivity to
    getCurrentWeather() retrieves weather data from the WeatherService
    web service only every 10 seconds, regardless of the number of
    times getCurrentWeather() is called by the WeatherActivity.  Any
    calls during the intervening time period should be serviced from
    the cache.  Although the cache should be thread-safe, you're free
    to make its data persistent (or not), as well as to share the
    cache (or not) between the two Bound Service implementations. </P>

    <LI> <P> To obtain weather-related information, the Bound Services
    will need to parse the Json data returned from making an HTTP GET
    request via the <A HREF="http://openweathermap.org/api">Open
    Weather Map API</a>.  An example of the Json data returned by API
    can be seen by opening <A
    HREF="http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Nashville,TN">this
    link</a> in your browser.  In addition to the videos on HTTP
    programming from week 3 and 4, helpful information about creating
    Plain Ol' Java Objects (POJOs) from Json schemes is available <A
    HREF="http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org">here</a>. There's also
    overview of a JsonReader parser <A
    HREF="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/JsonReader.html">here</a>.</P>

    <LI> <P> Please do not use any third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit,
    Jackson, etc.) in this assignment.  The first assignment in the <A
    HREF="http://www.coursera.org/course/mobilecloudprogram">next
    MOOC</a> will involve writing a variant of this assignment using
    Retrofit, Content Providers, and SQLite. </P>
    </UL>

    <P>The material necessary to complete assignment 3 is available in
    videos from Weeks 3 and 4 of the MOOC. </P>

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/assignments/assignment3">here</a>.
    The skeletons are intentionally incomplete to provide you with
    maximal creativity in your solution.  As a result, there are no
    automated unit tests for this assignment.  Therefore, make sure
    that your program works properly for both valid and invalid
    locations entered by the user. </p>

<h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
<p>

This assignment is designed to deepen your understanding with
programming Android Bound Services using the AIDL and Binder framework
in Java.  It will also give you experience parsing Json data retrieved
from a web service.  It's highly recommended to watch the videos
listed above and look at the various Bound Service examples <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/POSA-15/tree/master/ex">here</A>
to gain a better understanding of how to structure your solution.
Start early and come to Virtual Office Hours if you have questions or
run into problems.  </p>
