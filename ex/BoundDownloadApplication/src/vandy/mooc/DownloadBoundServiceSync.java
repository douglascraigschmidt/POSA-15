/**
 * @class DownloadBoundServiceSync
 *
 * @brief This class handles downloads using synchronous AIDL
 *        interactions.
 * 
 *        The component that binds to this service should receive an
 *        IBinder. This IBinder should be an instance of DownloadCall,
 *        which extends IBinder. The component can then interact with
 *        this service by making normal calls on the DownloadCall
 *        object. Specifically, the component can ask this service to
 *        download an image by calling downloadImage() on the
 *        DownloadCall object, which will run synchronously in this
 *        service until it finishes downloading and returns the file
 *        name of the downloaded file as a String.
 *  
 *        AIDL is an example of the Broker Pattern, in which all
 *        interprocess communication details are hidden behind the
 *        AIDL interfaces.
