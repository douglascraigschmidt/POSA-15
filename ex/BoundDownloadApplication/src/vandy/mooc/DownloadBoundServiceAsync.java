/**
 * @class DownloadBoundServiceAsync
 
 * @brief This class handles downloads using asynchronous AIDL
 *        interactions.  The component that binds to this service
 *        should receive an IBinder. This IBinder should be an
 *        instance of DownloadRequest, which extends IBinder. The
 *        component can then interact with this service by making
 *        normal calls on the DownloadRequest object. Specifically,
 *        the component can ask this service to download an image,
 *        passing in a DownloadResults object.  Once the download is
 *        finished, this service should send the pathname of the
 *        downloaded file back to the calling component by calling
 *        sendPath() on the DownloadResults object.
 *  
 *        AIDL is an example of the Broker Pattern, in which all
 *        interprocess communication details are hidden behind the
 *        AIDL interfaces.
